    "",
    "Ashravan woke to a palace that seemed to recognize him before he recognized himself. Names came first—the courtyards, the ministers, the river beyond the eastern gate—and then sensations: the weight of a crown he was not yet wearing, the ache of choices he had not yet made. Somewhere, like a brushstroke still drying, a craftsman’s miracle hummed against his soul.",
    "He rose. The attendants watched with a reverence edged by fear. He answered questions he hadn’t known he knew, charted memories like constellations: dinners with the council, a midnight stroll under lacquered lanterns, the quiet, stubborn resolve to do better than he had before. A woman’s shadow lingered in his thoughts—clever hands, a defiant gaze—gone now, but the echo of her work guided his breathing.",
    "By noon the corridors carried rumors faster than pages. Some said he was softer, others that he had returned tempered like steel quenched in snowmelt. Ashravan found the truth in motion. He listened to petitions, stayed a sentence, overturned a custom that had turned from tradition to cruelty in the span of a generation. Each decision tightened the weave of the man he was choosing to be.",
    "Evening drew him to the Hall of Bells, where the empire measured time not with sand or the sun, but with vows. The high ministers assembled under a vault of lacquer and gold. A bell waited, rope braided from silk dyed in imperial blues. If he rang it, he would confirm a treaty that would avert famine in the outer provinces—and embolden rivals at the heart.",
    "A whisper moved at the room’s edge, a sharpened absence of sound. Ashravan felt it—the knife of doubt, the breath of someone who wanted the old patterns to remain. He stepped forward anyway. The past and its guilt pressed like a storm against his back; the future lifted like wind under a falcon’s wing.",
    "He took the rope. For a heartbeat the world stilled, the miracle’s hum aligned with the thud of his pulse. Ashravan pulled. The bell’s strike cut clean through the hall, carrying a promise he chose in that instant to make his own. The assassin moved; so did Ashravan—toward the sound, toward the vow, toward the man he had decided to become."
